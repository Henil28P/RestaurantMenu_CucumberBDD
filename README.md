# RestaurantMenu_CucumberBDD-WebApp
A BDD and TDD-focused project using Cucumber tool with Java web app and Maven dependency/build management for performing BDD tests on Restaurant Menu project.

# Basic concepts of BDD:
- Defines software behaviour collaboratively with concrete examples
- Facilitates software testing as it focuses on software behaviour from the perspective of well-understood and well-defined software features written in business language
- Focuses on concrete examples or well-defined business rules or scenarios.
- Test-first approach (just like TDD) where you implement a system feature after the test case of that feature is already written.

<h3>Traditional Requirements Analysis Techniques</h3>
1. <b>Software requirements specifications</b> - eg. system shall do something, user will do something style
2. <b>Use case</b> - set of user-system interaction to produce a business value
3. <b>User story</b>

<h3>TDD (Test-first approach):</h3>
- Write test case
- Write code to fix compilation errors - test should still fail
- Write code to satisfy test
- Refactor and repeat

<h3>3 key aspects of BDD</h3>
1. Are you working collaboratively? (business, implementation and testing stakeholders are working together)
2. Are you defining software features as concrete examples?
3. Test-first development
